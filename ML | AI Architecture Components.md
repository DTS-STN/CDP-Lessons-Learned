# ML/AI Components of SAEB Architecture

Authors: Arpit Dhindsa

## Overview

The Service Analytics Evidence Base (SAEB) architecture is scoped to the cloud data and analytics platform that will enable analytics and evidenced based improvements to the digital channel.

This "Lessons Learned" document is meant to be a repository of institutional memory for hard-won insights and understanding around the tools and technologies used to develop the SAEB architecture.

## Context

This exercise involved researching the Machine Learning and AI services available in Azure Cloud. To do this we explored two distinct services: Azure Machine Learning (AML) and MLFlow. 

## Goals
The goal was to compare the two Machine Learning Tools available in Azure Cloud:
-	Azure Machine Learning(AML)
-	MLFlow
