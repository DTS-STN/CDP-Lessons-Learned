## Overview  

This "Lessons Learned" document is meant to be a repository of institutional memory for hard-won insights and understanding around the data and programming knowledge cultivated and created for the Stock Visualization.

## Context

The Client Data and Personalization team is tasked with measuring, tracking and analyzing data to help enable the success of SC Labs and the prototypes that they host. 
In October of 2021, CDP currently uses PowerBI as our platform for dashboarding and data visualization but the platform has a limited ability to allow users to manipulate and interact with data

## Goals
